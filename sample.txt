This is Experiment 2: Working with Git Shell Commands.

In this experiment, we learn how Git works by performing the following tasks:
1. Initializing a repository using git init.
2. Creating and modifying files.
3. Adding changes using git add.
4. Committing changes using git commit.
5. Creating and switching branches.
6. Merging branches.
7. Pushing code to GitHub.
